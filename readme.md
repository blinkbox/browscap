<p><b>Important</b></p>
<p>Please be sure to read about the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/browscap/kM8NWmmjqh8/IlZ8DkIwEqYJ" title="Part 1: Improving Mobile Device Recognition Accuracy">major changes to <i>the files</i></a> before doing anything here!</p>

<p><b>Welcome</b></p>
<p>We're getting older and our health isn't the best it's ever been, so increasingly the future of the <a href="https://browsers.garykeith.com" title="Visit the &quot;Browser Capabilities Project&quot; website.">Browser Capabilities Project</a> will be in your hands. It will eventually be up to you to help keep the data for the project current and accurate; although hopefully our departure won't happen for a long time&mdash;still, it's always good to be prepared.</p>

<p>We're getting older, and our health isn't good&mdash;we anticipate being around for many more years, so increasingly the future of the <a href="https://browsers.garykeith.com" title="Browser Capabilities Project -> Home">Browser Capabilities Project</a> will be in your hands. It will eventually be up to you to help keep the data for the project current and accurate.</p>

<p><b>Collaboration</b></p>
<p>Our main goal here is to encourage collaboration on several files that form the core of <a href="https://browsers.garykeith.com/terms#the-files" title="View our definition of the term, &quot;the files.&quot;"><i>the files</i></a>. The hope is that even if we can no longer maintain the project ourselves--including production of all <i>the files</i>, and can't find anyone who wants to take ownership of the project, at least there could still be a browscap.ini file.</p>
<p>At the moment those "several files" consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>browscap.ini</b><br>A beta version of the core file that's used to create all the other files we collectively refer to as <i>the files</i>.</li>
<li><b>devices.ini</b><br>Used to create the DeviceName property.</li>
<li><b>platforms.ini</b><br>Used to create the Platform property.</li>
<li><b>rendering-engines.ini</b><br>Used to create the RenderingEngine_Name property.</li>
<li><b>property-name-docs.ini</b><br>Documentation for all of the properties used in <i>the files</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Releases</b></p>
<p>Each new stable release of <i>the files</i> will be preceded by a tagged snapshot of the repository. The browscap.ini file in this snapshot will then be used to create the rest of <span class="bcp_the-files">the files</span>. These tags will create a readily available and easy to use archive of previous releases, which is something we've always wanted but &mdash;apart from a recent attempt on the main website&mdash;never fully got around to doing.</p>
<p>The format for these kinds of tags is: browscap-<b><i>&lt;version&gt;</i></b>, where <b>&lt;version&gt;</b> is the version number.</p>

<p><b>Feedback</b></p>
<p>We wish GitHub had a setup like the one we're using on Google Groups because then we'd keep everything on GitHub. But they don't, so we're using Google Groups to host our announcements and discussions. Please <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/browscap" title="Visit our Google Groups discussion page for project announcements, questions, and discussions.">post your questions and comments there</a>.</p>

<p><b>In Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Thanks in advance for whatever help you might offer.</p>
