<p><b>Welcome</b></p>

<p>We're getting older, and our health isn't good, so increasingly the future of the <a href="https://browsers.garykeith.com" title="Browser Capabilities Project -> Home">Browser Capabilities Project</a> will be in your hands. It will eventually be up to you to help keep the data for the project current and accurate.</p>

<p><b>Collaboration</b></p>

<p>Our main goal here is to encourage collaboration on several files that form the core of <a href="https://browsers.garykeith.com/terms#the-files" title="Browser Capabilities Project -> The Files"><i>the files</i></a>. The hope is that even if we can no longer maintain the project ourselves--including production of all <i>the files</i>, and can't find anyone who wants to take ownership of the project, at least there could still be a browscap.ini file.</p>

<p>At the moment those "several files" consist of:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>browscap.ini</b><br>A beta version of the core file that's used to create all the other files we collectively refer to as <i>the files</i>.</li>
<li><b>devices.ini</b><br>Used to create the DeviceName property.</li>
<li><b>platforms.ini</b><br>Used to create the Platform property.</li>
<li><b>rendering-engines.ini</b><br>Used to create the RenderingEngine_Name property.</li>
<li><b>property-name-docs.ini</b><br>Documentation for all of the properties used in <i>the files</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each new stable release of <i>the files</i> will be preceded by a tagged snapshot of the repository used to construct it. This will, in effect, be a readily available and easy to use archive of previous releases; which is something we've always wanted but never got around to doing.</p>

<p>The format for tags is: browscap-<b><i>&lt;version&gt;</i></b>, where <b>&lt;version&gt;</b> is the version number.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for whatever help you might offer.<br>~gary.</p>
